Just a simple little serialization framework I made for fun.

Simply instanciate an ObjectSerializer and read/write your objects away into whatever input/output streams you want.
Thats pretty much it. There isn't much to this project.

note: the name of the fields in a class should not be changed
if this is to be used to write to Files.

Collaborators are welcome to message me as i would love to get this project done at some point! :)
