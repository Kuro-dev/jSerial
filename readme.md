Just a simple little serialization framework I made for fun.



Collaborators are welcome to message me as i would love to get this project done at some point! :)

# Usage:

Just create an instance of ObjectSerializer and use the read/write methods
(class and method names may be subject to change in the future as this is still a work in progress)
# note: 

The names of fields in a class should not be changed
if this is to be used to write to Files.
